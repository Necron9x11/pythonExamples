# pythonExamples

Various Examples, and Derivitaves of Examples from Books, videos, etc.

This is me relearning how to code after years of being mostly a hardware/systems weenie.

This repo is a dumping ground for code snippets, examples, and other junk pulled from various sources - the web, books, videos, my ass... None of it is necessarily guaranteed to be finished/complete/proper/elegant/make-sense/not-suck or otherwise be useful to anyone else other than me, if even that. 

If you do something neat with what you find here I'd love to hear about it, though at this early stage I think it mostly probably, to anyone but myself, will be nada but cruft ( (crap+stuff+shit)/3 = cruft ) in here.

However, should you actually manage to find something here that piques your interest and which you think you can use it to learn something, or even better yet to incorporate into something useful of your own, then by all means pilfer from this reop. 

On the most remotest of remote chances you ever actually profit from anything here, or a derivative thereof, please buy a bum in your town a beer from me and we will call it even.

The only guarantee extended is that if you chose to use it and it breaks you get to keep both halves.
